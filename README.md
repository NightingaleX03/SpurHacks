## 🚀 Features

### 🏗️ Diagram Generation
- Create **architecture, UML, enitity relationship diagramss and more from scratch** using vague or detailed prompts.
- Supports multiple architecture styles: **Monolith**, **Microservices**, **Serverless**, etc.
- Apply **design constraints** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure services, specific frameworks).
- Suggest multiple layout options and architectural strategies.
- Export to Confluence, PNG, or SVG.

### ✍️ Real-Time Editing & Collaboration
- Edit any diagrams **live** with teammates.
- Suggest **smart edits** based on code changes or new requirements.
- Track and highlight architecture-impacting updates automatically.
- Maintain **multiple diagrams per project** with full version history.

### 🔍 Deep Codebase Understanding
- The alogrithm will use RAG to understand your codebase and instantly generate diagrams using **semantic search**.
- **Query your current codebase**:  
  _"How does the login system work?"_  
  _"Where is the business logic for payment validation?"_
- **Trace feature flows** across files and layers, with file path links in generated visuals.
- Automatically update diagrams as your code evolves.
- **Onboarding Made Easy** 

### 🧠 AI Capabilities
- Powered by a **fine-tuned LLaMA 3 2B model**.
- Uses **A fine-tuned model** to provide code-accurate insights.
- Refines understanding with **code context**, not just comments or docstrings.

### 👋 Onboarding Made Easy
- Help new developers onboard faster with interactive architectural overviews and smart, visual queries that explain your codebase from day one.
